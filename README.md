I am into PC advanced user workshop, and Operating System differences and variables, capabilites, updates, Advanced hardware, software, or whatever that might improve the preformance of a PC and/or 
an operating system, program, or feature. I like testing out new upcoming software and equipment that is still in test, trial or expermental standings. I like commiting my PC to having between 8
and 40 different operating systems, server, or slave servers that operate of the one unit. I don't really believe that a person can have to much memory and storage, I just wish that I could get more periphial 
advantages to work at the same time with causing overload to the CPU's or overheating the motherboard or components. I try many features and "not permitted" by the manufacture of the product to try certian 
methods and hardwarw out to inhance or promote the advantages of maxing out the capablities while exploring the probabilities out to preform task and advanced techniquies that a lot of people dont even know that there PC is able to do.
I have had my PC loaded with 18 SSD and working both sides of the interface in quad interloop to do an install of an operating system having one part of the periphials workimg through the PXE Iv4 internet to the mainframe of the device to
install on a hard drive, while yet the PCI breakout was giving the slave server a update of new files that took 5 hours to complete. So I spend a lot of time playing with them, hoping that someone will develope a cradle backup tool that can attach
to any file system and format and create backups of different operating systems on one device, like the Mac, red hat, windows, oracle & servers, linux with there wide span of systems and software, the freebird enterprise, and so on. Cause it can be hecktic
keeping track of which backup file came from which OS so that it can be decompressed and synced back to normal encryption with the proper software that made the backup file. I use the keep the backups sepeate because of the differences in file format and
the currupt file formats that one OS runs in but another cant see in, or go in and the like, but since the incorperation of intergrating a system and server to storage, files can then be carried over to a currupt file format as long as they are not gonna try 
to be opened, viewed, used or whatever, but there for storage archiving only, I chose to just upload them all to one large storage back, and let the cheif file commander of the unit evaluate the age and redundant backups and descard the 
6th on in line on all systems but the operational programs server, and those get recycled back for tolorance to outdated or usability, so I stay bbusy with keeping things going. I think that there is software out that will copy/clone a hard drive with
whatever on it and not damage the systems and files on the copied drive. I was told that AOMEI cas a partition software, and backup software that makes exact clones of any hard drive and file system, doing that copy sector by sector, or block by block.
I might give it a try and see if they have done it right for a hard drive with 5 different OS on it that dont vary with each other. Well I have some troubleshooting to do with 5 PC all throwing an I/O error of there periphials without it effecting the OS hard drive.
I think it might be a signing certificate thing or something to do with the signing of the unit to its parts, just 5 at the same time, hasd me stumped at the moment. I don't know if someonwe trying doing the same act on them all or if it happened with a sytems update, 
or just what started the action error to happen, but it throws the error coopying from one pc to another, one hard drive to another, uploading of downloading, and every so often just jumps into a system error and needs to restart because of an unknown error accured. I 
pulled the files from computer management and went threw the caller log and seen that the kernel panics was being tripped do to I/O errors and inconsitent returns on in and out processes that require HPET to record. In the XML files, I found that there was IEEE drivers that
were not signed to be installed, and that the unknown device was capable of Adminstative actions within the system. The device was external RAID drive with a slave server on the same controller and bus. Even after I have fixed that issue, it still gives errors burning dvd, data disc,
and the copying between PC on the same network. So I got work to do. Anyone with any advice is more than welcome to email me with some troubleshooting advice. I gotta figure this out. Thanks.
